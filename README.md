⚠️ Disclaimer
⚠️ This project is intended for educational purposes only.

The scripts included in this repository are designed to demonstrate common reconnaissance techniques (e.g., DNS scanning, TCP port scanning) in cybersecurity, aligned with phases like Pre-ATT&CK reconnaissance.

Do not run these scripts on networks, domains, or systems that you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.

Unauthorized scanning or probing may be considered illegal or unethical, depending on your jurisdiction and target.

Always obtain written consent before testing any third-party infrastructure.

The author is not responsible for any misuse of the code.

Use responsibly, learn safely. 


This repository contains scripts based on the "Python for Cybersecurity Specialization" course by Howard Poston.

The course offers a hands-on introduction to using Python for various cybersecurity tasks.

These scripts were not originally created by me — they are transcriptions and adaptations for Windows users based on code demonstrated in the course videos.

However, I reserve the right to modify, improve, or adapt them over time for learning purposes and to showcase them as part of my technical portfolio.
