This repository contains scripts based on the "Python for Cybersecurity Specialization" course by Howard Poston.

The course offers a hands-on introduction to using Python for various cybersecurity tasks.

These scripts were not originally created by me â€” they are transcriptions and adaptations for Windows users based on code demonstrated in the course videos.

However, I reserve the right to modify, improve, or adapt them over time for learning purposes and to showcase them as part of my technical portfolio.
